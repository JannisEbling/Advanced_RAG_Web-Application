Determine which data source is most appropriate for answering the query.

Query: {{ question }}

Available sources:
- arxiv: Latest research papers and cutting-edge developments in ML/AI
- vectorstore: Comprehensive machine learning book covering:
  * Deep Learning fundamentals and applications
  * Probability theory and distributions
  * Neural network architectures
  * Optimization and regularization
  * Computer vision and transformers
  * Graph neural networks
  * Generative models and sampling

Examples:

Example 1:
Query: "What is backpropagation?"
Analysis:
- Basic ML concept covered in textbook
- Chapter 8 specifically covers this
- No need for latest research
Result: {"datasource": "vectorstore", "confidence_score": 0.95}

Example 2:
Query: "Latest developments in large language models"
Analysis:
- Seeks current research beyond textbook
- Rapidly evolving field
- Need recent papers
Result: {"datasource": "arxiv", "confidence_score": 0.9}

Provide a JSON response with:
- datasource: either "arxiv" or "vectorstore"
- confidence_score: 0-1 score (1 = completely certain)
