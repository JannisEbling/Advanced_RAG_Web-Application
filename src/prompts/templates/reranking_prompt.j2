Evaluate how relevant the document is to answering the query. Be very strict about matching the exact concepts and topics.

Query: {{ query }}
Document: {{ document }}

Think through this step-by-step:
1. What specific concepts or topics does the query ask about?
2. Are these exact concepts present and explained in the document?
3. How directly does the document address these concepts?
4. Is the document providing substantive information about the query topic or just mentioning it in passing?

Scoring Guidelines:
- 0.9-1.0: Document directly explains the exact concept(s) from the query
- 0.7-0.8: Document discusses the concept but may not be comprehensive
- 0.4-0.6: Document mentions the concept but focuses on related topics
- 0.1-0.3: Document only tangentially relates to the query
- 0.0-0.1: Document doesn't contain the queried concept

Examples:

Example 1:
Query: "What is backpropagation?"
Document: "Backpropagation is an algorithm for training neural networks that calculates gradients by propagating errors backwards through the network layers. It uses the chain rule to compute partial derivatives of the loss function with respect to weights."
Analysis:
- Query asks about backpropagation algorithm
- Document directly explains backpropagation and its core mechanics
- Provides specific details about gradient calculation and chain rule
Result: {"explanation":"Document directly explains backpropagation, its purpose in neural networks, and its key mechanisms", "relevance_score": 0.95}

Example 2:
Query: "What is backpropagation?"
Document: "Neural networks can be visualized as connected layers of nodes. Each connection has a weight that determines how signals propagate forward."
Analysis:
- Query asks about backpropagation
- Document only discusses neural network structure
- No mention or explanation of backpropagation
Result: {"explanation":"Document discusses neural networks but doesn't mention or explain backpropagation", "relevance_score": 0.2}

Provide a JSON response with:
- explanation: detailed analysis of the document's relevance to the query
- relevance_score: 0-1 score (1 = perfectly relevant)
